## An open-source C2K recreation

R2K is an open-source version of the Northern Irish school website [C2K](https://www.c2kschools.net). 

The R2K project aims to both make the website easier to explore and edit, while also adding numerous features to the site's functionality, such as:

- Custom themes
- Custom profile pictures
- Custom widgets
- Custom apps
- Removal of tracker cookies

While a lot of the site will require a login to access most of the apps (as they are managed by C2K), however all widgets work perfectly fine without a login and R2K itself does not require a login.

## How can I use R2K?
A public online demo is available [here,](https://vlri4.github.io/WebsiteProject/r2k.html) however this lacks some features (such as custom profile pictures) as R2K is designed to be edited and used as an offline website.

If you want R2K to save your customisation options, you can run it via http-server.
- Install node.js
- Install http-server via `npm install -g http-server`
- CD into R2K's directory (where index.html is present)
- Type `http-server` and hit enter
- Access any of the provided links

## Download?
You can download a copy of R2K [here.](https://github.com/vlri4/R2K/releases)

Or, download a copy of the code via GitHub.
