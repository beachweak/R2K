# An open-source C2K recreation

R2K is an open-source version of the Northern Irish school website [C2K](https://www.c2kschools.net). 

The R2K project aims to both make the website easier to explore and edit, while also adding numerous features to the site's functionality, such as:

- Custom themes
- Custom profile pictures
- Custom widgets
- Custom apps
- Removal of tracker cookies

While a lot of the site will require a login to access most of the apps (as they are managed by C2K), however all widgets work perfectly fine without a login and R2K itself does not require a login.
