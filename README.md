## An open-source port of C2K

R2K is an attempt to open-source the NI-based school portal [C2K](https://www.c2kschools.net).

The project's main goals are to make the site easier to edit and to code for, while adding new custom content, such as:

- User-created themes
- Custom profile pictures
- User-created widgets
- Conversion from ASPX to HTML

Additionally, R2K also does the following:

- Fixes many originally broken widgets with new functionality
- Brings small adjustments to existing widgets
- Fix file structure to make themes easier to create
- Manages scripts in an easy to understand format

R2K removes the login system from C2K, allowing any user to access the site.
While sign in is removed and does not affect 99% of site functionality, some apps may require a C2K login.

## How do I use R2K?
There are a few ways you can run R2K:

- Run the web demo [here](https://vlri4.xyz/R2K/index.html)
- Download an offline copy [here](https://github.com/plecakserce/R2K/releases)
- Run it through http-server to let your offline copy save customisation features

## Are there issues with R2K?
R2K only contains minor issues, such as:

- Offline copies do not hold customisation choices for long
- Because of the removal of a login system and server functions, customisation choices rely on browser cookies and local storage
- Some pages of the original C2K are removed for privacy / copyright concerns
- Not all widgets have been recoded or ported to R2K

## Credits
R2K borrows almost all its assets from the original C2K project (as it is a port). Some features, such as the theme changer and others are coded or fixed by [plecakserce](https://github.com/plecakserce).

"Fluff" & "Doodle Cats" themes as well as "Hoppo", "Gradient Joe", "Gerbo", "Kitty" and "Dancing Banana" profile pictures seen within R2K was created by [SAMMZYO_O](https://sammzy404.newgrounds.com/).
