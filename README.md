## An open-source C2K recreation

R2K is an open-source version of the Northern Irish school website [C2K](https://www.c2kschools.net). 

R2K aims to both make the website easier to explore and edit, while also adding numerous features to the site's functionality, such as:

- Custom themes
- Custom profile pictures
- Custom widgets
- Custom apps
- Conversion from ASPX to HTML
- Removal of login requirement

C2K managed apps will require a login, while third party apps obviously do not. All of R2K's main functionality works perfectly fine without a login.

## How can I use R2K?
A public online demo is available [here,](https://vlri4.github.io/WebsiteProject/r2k.html) however this lacks some features (such as custom profile pictures) as R2K is designed to be edited and used as an offline website. Simply download a release of R2K, unzip it and run index.html to get started.

Alternatively, if you want R2K to save your customisation options while still running it offline, you can run it via http-server.
- Install node.js
- Install npm
- Install http-server via `npm install -g http-server`
- Navigate into R2K's directory (where index.html is present)
- Type `http-server` and hit enter
- Access any of the provided URLs in your console

## Download?
You can download a copy of R2K [here.](https://github.com/vlri4/R2K/releases)

If your art is present in R2K and you don't want it to be, please open an issue report. It will be removed shortly after.
